    "## Top findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brooklyn leads in the number of schools:\n",
    "\n",
    "Brooklyn has the most schools of any borough, with 121 high schools. Interestingly, \n",
    "all of them accept ninth graders. However, many schools start earlier (on average \n",
    "in grade 8.43) because they also offer middle school programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### All boroughs offer complete high school education:\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every school goes up to 12th grade, regardless of the borough. The average \n",
    "is between 11.82 and 12.00, which shows that students everywhere can complete \n",
    "high school.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combined middle and high school:\n",
    "\n",
    "The average starting grade varies between boroughs: Staten Island \n",
    "usually starts at grade 9 (typical high school start), while Queens (8.39) \n",
    "and Brooklyn (8.43) often start earlier. This means that these schools have \n",
    "integrated middle school programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are major differences here:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Staten Island: Only 10 schools, but really big (average of 1,848 students)\n",
    "- Queens:        Also large schools (1,047 students per school)\n",
    "- Brooklyn:      Medium-sized schools (699 students)\n",
    "- Manhattan:     Similar to Brooklyn (590 students)\n",
    "- Bronx:         Smaller schools (490 students)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fazit:\n",
    "\n",
    "All boroughs offer complete high school education through grade 12. Staten Island \n",
    "has few but large schools – with fewer residents, central locations are more worthwhile .\n",
    "Brooklyn and other densely populated boroughs have many smaller schools \n",
    "closer to the students. Each borough adapts the size and number of schools to its \n",
    "population structure."
